    <h1>Automatic Emails</h1>
    <p>Due to the fkn bullshit restrictions of hosting and email providers,<br>
    i am forced to send email through free GMX accounts instead of my domain. ðŸ˜¡<br>
    if discussion was a more serious project i could maybe pay for a professional email service,<br>
    but as it stands, i aint paying shit</p>
